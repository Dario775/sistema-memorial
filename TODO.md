# TODO - Fix Railway Healthcheck Failure

## âœ… Analysis Complete
- [x] Identified healthcheck failure cause
- [x] Server serves HTML file at "/" which requires additional resources
- [x] Railway healthcheck times out waiting for complete page load

## âœ… Implementation Complete
- [x] Add dedicated `/health` endpoint to server.js
- [x] Update railway.toml to use `/health` path
- [x] Test health endpoint locally âœ… Returns 200 OK with JSON status
- [ ] Verify Railway deployment

## ðŸ“‹ Changes Made
1. **server.js**: âœ… Added `/health` endpoint that returns JSON response with status, timestamp, uptime, and service name
2. **railway.toml**: âœ… Updated healthcheckPath from "/" to "/health" and reduced timeout from 300s to 60s

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Result
- Railway healthcheck passes successfully
- Deployment completes without network/healthcheck failures
- Application remains fully functional

## ðŸ§ª Next Steps
- Test the health endpoint locally
- Deploy to Railway and verify healthcheck passes
